### Story
Basic mechanical cutter is made for simple cutting of vegetables.it is based on four bar mechanisam.it is made with two parts that is head and leg .head contains  a blade and leg is made with reamaining body.

### Synopsis
The MPC tool also delivers precise downhole pipe cutting without damaging external tubulars. Cutting penetration is continuously measured and controlled, confirming the cut has been made and avoiding damage to external tubulars or control lines. The MPCâ€™s temperature and pressure ratings allow you to cut pipe in hotter and deeper environments while eliminating expensive and time-consuming coiled-tubing or pipe operations.

Our revolutionary pipe cutter saves time with rapid deployment, a controlled cut with minimal debris, and confirms the pipe cut has been made and is free before coming out of the hole. If the pipe is not free, the MPC enables you to attempt another cut while downhole, saving hours of time. The MPC can be used on a variety of pipe types and sizes: drillpipe, tubing, and casing from standard steel to superalloys. The MPC can cut pipe at any angle, including horizontal.
